# colour-scheme-generator
This colour scheme generator is built with Vanilla JavaScript. The user is able to select base colour and colour scheme type in order to generate a new colour scheme consisting of 5 colours based on the inputs provided.

## Demo

## Built with
HTML5
CSS Flexbox
Vanilla JavaScript
The Color API: https://www.thecolorapi.com/docs#schemes

## Lessons Learned
This was my first project where I requested data from a third-party API on my own. Ran into a lot of trial and error, especially with deciding how I was going to render the background colours back into the DOM. 

## Future Updates
Allow users to be able to click hex values and have it copied to clipboard
Instead of the default 5 colours, users can input the number of colours to return
Refactor logic, to make it DRYer
